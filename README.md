## Few sentences of the solution

Wanted to "gamify" this solution so that's why I added some graphics when I had
the first version ready. Actually first time I tried VSCode as editor, could have
prefered old habits and done this with VIM on Ubuntu but wanted to try something new.
There is a lot of things to improve in the code but hey, it works :)
